[[file:images/oer.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- OER started in around 2002 by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation
- Producing resources that are licensed so as to allow free use and re-purposing
- How teachers usually create resources:
  - Individually
  - Not shared or just shared within a department
  - Often shared using formats such as PDF to prevent modification
- Better way - using open platforms and nor proprietary formats.
- Raspberry Pi Foundation uses markdown and GitHub to produce and distribute resources
#+END_NOTES
* Generating resources
#+attr_html: :height 500px
[[file:images/resources.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- We have dozens of resources and more added each week
- Aimed at younger learners
- Used at home, clubs and in schools
#+END_NOTES
* Start a project
[[file:images/generate.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- We have an online app that integrates with a database for when we want a new resource
#+END_NOTES
* Create a repo
[[file:images/db-create.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Creating a resource also creates a repo. We have bot that does this for us
- Previously this was a manual job each time.
- This saves us time and prevents mistakes
#+END_NOTES
* Clone
#+attr_html: :height 500px
[[file:images/repo.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- We then clone the repo
- Mix of OS at the office - Linux, mac and windows
- Copy editors often just use the web interface
#+END_NOTES
* How we make content
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[file:images/editors.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Use a variety of editors to edit the markdown
#+END_NOTES
* Markdown
[[file:images/markdown.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Markdown is pretty standard, with a few embellishments to make it a little more expressive
Push to draft triggers a webhook that pull content into staging
Push to master does the same to a live project

#+END_NOTES
* Pull requests
#+attr_html: :height 500px
