#+BEGIN_NOTES
- OER started in around 2002 by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation
- Producing resources that are licensed so as to allow free use and re-purposing
- How teachers usually create resources:
  - Individually
  - Not shared or just shared within a department
  - Often shared using formats such as PDF to prevent modification
- Better way - using open platforms and nor proprietary formats.
- Raspberry Pi Foundation uses markdown and GitHub to produce and distribute resources
